  <p>This program requires pygame and numpy to run correctly</p>

```bash
  # to install these dependencies you should run this command on your terminal
  pip install pygame numpy
```

```bash
  # then run the program as the following
  python ./main.py "cube.csv"
  # if you prefer pyramids rather than cubes, run the next command
  python ./main.py "pyramid.csv"
```
